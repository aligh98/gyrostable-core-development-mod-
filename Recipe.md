# What remains

0. Finalize the frontend hooks for Leland
1. Uniswap oracle for BAL price
2. Work out which oracle contracts to deploy for which pools, check these are on testnet
3. Finalize the mint and redeem functions
4. Finish implementing the AMM (our price oracle)


<!-- Task 1
Check the optimal weights for pools
Check current weights
Check if new weights would be deviated past acceptable limits per pools

Task 2
What is the offering price?
Ideally moving average inflow outflow parameters
- For mint, get insurance pricing in
- For redeem, something like this as well? -->
